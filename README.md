Entity Component System
=======================

> Entity-component-system (ECS) is an architectural pattern that is mostly

This library implement the entity component system pattern in EcmaScript6.

## Features

 * ES6. 
 * Barebone. No bullshit. No black magic. Take a look at the sources.
 * Flexible. You can subclass the Entity or UIDGenerator classes to implement your own logic. e.g. extend the System class in an EventEmitterSystem class to allow inter-system communication!
 * Fast. Intelligently batch your entities and systems so that the minimum amount of time is spent on pure iteration. Benchmarks in a <hope>near</hope> future.
 * Fast even for ECS. The eligibility to systems is computed only when components list change, and in most cases the overhead of systems eligibility will be computed once per entity, when added. Therefore there is no overhead for most iterations. [Iteration is often considered as a flaw of ecs pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#Drawbacks).
